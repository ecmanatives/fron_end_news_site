# Front end news site
This news site exists out of 2 main components:

- A backend server that serves some pages, api's and a bunch of static materials
- A front-end webpack engine that turns fancy webpack ES6 modules into a static
  matieral file for the backend.


## Installation
Installation is pretty straight forward:

Create a new fork (your own copy) of this repo (to save it to your own Github Account):

With that done Click the fancy download button (on your own fork that is) and
copy the `ssh`-link:

Done? open a new terminal window and clone your private copy:

Cool, We now have 2 folders in our private copy:

- backend
- front-end

We're going to prepare both, let's start with backend:

Once done, you can actually visit http://localhost:3000/. It's not possible to
change the JavaScripts for the front-end components of the page yet.

Open a new terminal window (just leave the old one sitting in the background)
and execute the following commands:

And that's it! You can now start developing awesome front-end stuff!!!
